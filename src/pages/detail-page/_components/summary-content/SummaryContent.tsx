        Min Harang’s future is clear. Go to KNU law school, become a prosecutor,
        and be successful. At least, that’s what her mother wants. But when
        Harang fails the entrance exam, she has to come to terms with the fact
        that her mother’s wishes might not line up with Harang’s own. Out
        sulking in the rain after an explosive argument, help comes in the form
        of her sex-crazed neighbor – the very man who’s constant moaning
        distracted her from studying! And since it’s his fault anyway, it’s only
        fair that he take responsibility, right? But there’s more to the man
        that first appears, and soon Harang finds herself coming face to face
        with a different form of family. It just goes to show that home is truly
        where the heart is.
